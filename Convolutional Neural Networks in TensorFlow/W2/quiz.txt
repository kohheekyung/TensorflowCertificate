1. How do you use Image Augmentation in TensorFLow
Using parameters to the ImageDataGenerator

2. If my training data only has people facing left, but I want to classify people facing right, how would I avoid overfitting?
Use the ‘horizontal_flip’ parameter

3. When training with augmentation, you noticed that the training is a little slower. Why?
Because the image processing takes cycles

4. What does the fill_mode parameter do?
It attempts to recreate lost information after a transformation like a shear

5. When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.
Nothing, all augmentation is done in-memory

6. How does Image Augmentation help solve overfitting?
It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images

7. When using Image Augmentation my training gets...
Slower

8. Using Image Augmentation effectively simulates having a larger data set for training.
True
